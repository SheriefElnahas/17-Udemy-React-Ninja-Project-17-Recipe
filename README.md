# Cooking Recipe

Add your favorite cooking recipe.

## Project Description

The idea for this project is taken from Net Ninja React Course on Udemy. I just saw the first video and took the idea. But the implementation is completely different.

## Getting Started

This project was created using vite not create-react-app. Also, this project is using json-server package as a database. To run the project use this command

```
npm install
```

And to run json-server package use this command

```
npm run start
```

## This Project Was Aimed To Practice

- Functional Components
- useState, useEffect Hooks
- API GET & Post Using Axios
- Working With JSON-Server Package As A Simple Database
- Working With Vite
- React Router

## Buggs & Future Improvments

- Recipes Does not re-render after you create a new recipe
- Allow The user to enter ingredients one by one and click add button
- After clicking on add button, the ingredients should appear under the label
- Handle error cases in axios
- Make a better UI by telling the user that he have to fill the entire form for the recipe to be created
- Create a custom hook to handle get and post methods
